School of Santhi’s Yoga Teacher Training programme aims at reforming serious spiritual seekers into masters of yoga. The programme is not just restricted to a set of physical exercises/asanas. It deals with the practical application of ancient wisdom of Raja Yoga, Kundalini yoga, Swara yoga, Samkhya yoga, Patanjali’s Yoga sutra etc.. for a better understanding of the functioning of the body and mind. </span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-d1535381-b7ed-1977-c793-bb20c1a90cd7\"><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Santhi has carefully designed this programme to aid in one’s complete transformation in accordance with the ancient Gurukula System. The salient feature of this age-old system is the total involvement of the Master in imparting knowledge to his disciples in an atmosphere of love and compassion. </span></p><p style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51);\"><br></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); line-height: 1.38;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">To ensure personal attention to all, we facilitate the courses in small groups. Chosen people from all over the world come to us for learning this art of transformation and they in turn propose this science to their students.
