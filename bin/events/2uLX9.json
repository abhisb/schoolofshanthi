School of Santhi’s Yoga Teacher Training programme aims at reforming serious spiritual seekers into masters of yoga. The programme is not just restricted to a set of physical exercises/asanas. It deals with the practical application of ancient wisdom of Raja Yoga, Kundalini yoga, Swara yoga, Samkhya yoga, Patanjali’s Yoga sutra etc.. for a better understanding of the functioning of the body and mind. </span></p><p><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-d1535381-b7ed-1977-c793-bb20c1a90cd7\"><br></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Santhi has carefully designed this programme to aid in one’s complete transformation in accordance with the ancient Gurukula System. The salient feature of this age-old system is the total involvement of the Master in imparting knowledge to his disciples in an atmosphere of love and compassion. </span></p><p><b style=\"font-weight:normal;\"><br></b></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre-wrap;\">To ensure personal attention to all, we facilitate the courses in small groups.
