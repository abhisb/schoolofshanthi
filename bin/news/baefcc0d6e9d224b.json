{"title":"SPIRITUAL RETREATS","description":"Santhi’s workshops on meditation, yoga therapy, karma etc.. are very simple and offer practical solutions to painful problems, both mental and physical. With a warm and loving approach, Santhi gives the audience an opportunity to understand themselves and provides tools to improve the quality of life in his workshops. \n\nThe world is so hallucinating that we are grabbed fully by its experience. We are often self-assured and believe that we understand everything around us. Santhi challenges our beliefs and guides us into seeing things in a different way - a way in which you start looking deeply within yourself, see all the subtle aspects of the mind and its relation with prana - the vital force. You will learn to understand yourself without the backing of any concepts whatsoever.\n\nHis teachings are suitable for people of all faiths, as well as both beginners and experienced practitioners. The benefits of his teachings have been tested and proven by time.","highlight":"Santhi’s workshops on meditation, yoga therapy, karma etc.. are very simple and offer practical solutions to painful problems, both mental and physical.
