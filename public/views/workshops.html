                    <p>Santhiâ€™s workshops on meditation, yoga therapy, karma etc.. are very simple and offer practical solutions to painful problems, both mental and physical. With a warm and loving approach, Santhi gives the audience an opportunity to understand themselves and provides tools to improve the quality of life in his workshops. </p>
                    <p>The world is so hallucinating that we are grabbed fully by its experience. We are often self-assured and believe that we understand everything around us. Santhi challenges our beliefs and guides us into seeing things in a different way - a way in which you start looking deeply within yourself, see all the subtle aspects of the mind and its relation with prana - the vital force. You will learn to understand yourself without the backing of any concepts whatsoever.  </p>
                    <p>His teachings are suitable for people of all faiths, as well as both beginners and experienced practitioners. The benefits of his teachings have been tested and proven by time.</p></section>
