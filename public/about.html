    <h1>School of Santhi</h1>
    <p>In 1993 Swami Santhiprasad established his School of Santhi Yoga School in Trivandrum, with the blessings of his Master Bhaskara Pillai Swamikal. The purpose was to enable people to look into themselves for solutions. To know oneself you have to look deep inside.</p>
<p>The world is so hallucinating that we are grabbed fully by its experience. We are often very self-assured and believe we understand everything around us. Santhi challenge our beliefs and guide us to see things in a different way. A way in which you start seeing the world from your own self and go further to start seeing, feeling and knowing yourself a little bit more. By looking into the question “Who am I” you will start knowing yourself. You will learn to see all the subtle aspects of the mind and its relation with prana – the vital force. You will learn to understand yourself without the backing of any concepts what so ever.</p>

<p>Since the start the School of Santhi Yoga School teach traditional Yoga for serious spiritual seekers on a regular basis.Since the start the School of Santhi Yoga School teach traditional Yoga for serious spiritual seekers on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Just as envisaged in the traditional Indian Gurukula system, personal attention is ensured to each disciple and to facilitate this our sessions are conducted in small groups.</p>
